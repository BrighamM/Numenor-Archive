Here are the instructions on how to set up the vscode

throw on the git graph and the git lense those are essential

download the hack font and use that.

then go to settings and change the font family to
```Hack, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace```

Now to integrate the wsl terminal into vscode you need to ... put this line into settings.json
The path is:
```C:\Users\bmichaelis\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json```

```"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe"```



To get vscode to work the way I like with Git I had to install the windows version of git,
put my user.name and user.email into it. Then fancy commits would work.
