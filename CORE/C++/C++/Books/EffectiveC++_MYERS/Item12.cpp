/**
 * 
 * ITEM 12: Copy all parts of an object.
 * 
 * Things to remember
 * 1. Copying functions should be sure to copy all of an object's data members and
 * all of its base class parts.
 * 
 * 2. Don't try to implement on of the copying functions in terms of the other. 
 * Instead, put common functionality in a third function that both call.
 * (typically called init(...)  ) 
 *
