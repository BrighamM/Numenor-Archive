// Structural Patterns.

/**
 * 
 * Decorator - kind of like customizing a starbucks drink, but not a good example. Wrap a thing in layers.
 * Adapter - converts an interface
 * Facade - Make a facade over some complex behavior to simplify crazy complexity
 * Proxy - Prevent expensive things from happening until they must happen Lazy-working
 * Bridge - prevent major multiplicitive work when creating many types of classes
 * 
 * Draw the UML to see the structure of how the patterns work. This can help identify
 * if it is appropriate to use the pattern at all.
