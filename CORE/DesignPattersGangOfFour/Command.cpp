// Think kind of like adobe photoshop.
// You are going to want to keep a rolling history of the commands or actions that a client has taken.
// Then when a client wants to undo(ctrl-z) or redo(ctrl-y) it as easy as doing on undoing commands
// that you are keeping track if in some queue or some list.

// THIS IS SUPER ELEGANT!!!!
